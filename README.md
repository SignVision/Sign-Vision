### Inspiration
In these times, clear communication is more important than ever before. With over 72 million people in the world being deaf (UN), it is extremely important that those who are hearing impaired get access to the services they need in a safe and comfortable manner. From official communications to accessing small businesses, it is crucial that those who are deaf have a quick and easy aid, in the very likely case that the service or retail workers are unable to communicate with them in sign language.

### About
Sign vision is an android app that improves communication and accessibility at local businesses and services. 

Through Sign Vision, users can record someone performing sign language through their phone while receiving a text translation in real time. In contrast, users may also speak to the phone and will also receive a sign language interpretation of their speech. Finally, if one were to type their text into Sign Vision, they would also receive a sign language translation.
